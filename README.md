SQL based energy usage and billing analytics for CNP 
# CenterPoint Energy SQL Project

# CenterPoint Energy Analytics SQL Project

##  Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world analytics pipeline for a utility company (CenterPoint Energy). Using dummy energy usage and revenue data across Texas ZIP codes, I built a PostgreSQL database, cleaned and analyzed large datasets, and generated key performance insights. 

This was created to showcase my SQL and analytical skills for a Senior Data Analyst role — the goal was to demonstrate:
- Data ingestion from CSVs into a PostgreSQL database via pgAdmin
- Table creation and foreign key relationships
- Writing and executing real SQL queries for business insight
- Exporting query results to CSVs for visualization tools (Power BI/Tableau)
- Project organization for GitHub and LinkedIn portfolios

---

##  Files Included
- `CNP small.sql` – All SQL code for table creation and analytical queries
- `zip_data.csv` – ZIP code info (dummy city, county, state data)
- `energy_consumption.csv` – Electricity usage data
- `revenue_data.csv` – Revenue collected per ZIP
- `monthly_usage.csv`, `monthly_rev.csv`, `usage vs rev.csv` – Aggregated outputs
- `Peak Usage ZIP.csv`, `usage by zip.csv`, `rev by zipcode.csv` – Exported query results

---

##  Tools Used
- PostgreSQL 17
- pgAdmin 4
- GitHub (for version control and portfolio hosting)

---

##  Key Queries Performed
- Monthly energy consumption by ZIP
- Total billed revenue by ZIP and city
- Peak usage ZIP codes
- Comparative analysis: usage vs. revenue

Visualization Strategy (Power BI/Tableau)

Although this project was built using dummy utility data, it is fully designed to support real-time dashboards in Power BI or Tableau through direct SQL connections or .csv imports. Below is how I would structure the visual reporting layer:

⸻

Connection Setup
Power BI Desktop:
Connect via Get Data > PostgreSQL Database
Use SQL queries directly or import tables (consumption, revenue, zip_data)
Enable auto-refresh if hosted via cloud or SQL Server
Tableau Public/Desktop:
Connect using PostgreSQL Connector
Import tables or use custom SQL
Join visually or use pre-exported .csv results

⸻

Dashboard 1: Energy Usage Overview
KPI Tiles:
Total kWh Consumed
Average Monthly Usage
Peak ZIP Code Usage
Bar Chart
Top 10 ZIP Codes by Energy Usage
Map Visualization:
Usage heatmap by ZIP code (Texas overlay)

⸻
Dashboard 2: Billing & Revenue
KPI Tiles:
Total Revenue Collected
Average Revenue per ZIP
Clustered Bar Chart:
Top ZIP Codes by Revenue
Line Chart:
Usage vs Revenue trend by month

⸻

Dashboard 3: Executive Insights for CenterPoint Energy
Scatter Plot:
Usage vs Billed Amount per ZIP (highlighting outliers)
Heat Map:
Usage intensity by county
Filters:
State, ZIP Code, Billing Month

⸻

Additional Visual Features
Tooltips for ZIP, city, county info
Drill-downs from County → ZIP → Month
Interactive slicers for advanced user control

I built this project end-to-end to demonstrate my SQL fluency, analytical thinking, and comfort working with large volumes of data. Even without real CenterPoint data, this shows how I’d approach a real-world energy analytics problem.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
